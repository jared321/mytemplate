subB Amazing Optimization Method
======================================
We are pretending that this is an optimization tool such as Manifold Sampling
with a MATLAB and a Python implementation.

We imagine that subB shares some commonality with subA so that it is sensible
for both to be packaged together in
[mytemplate_pypkg](https://github.com/jared321/mytemplate/tree/main/mytemplate_pypkg/src/mytemplate).
However, since subA and subB are separate tools, they are located in the repo as
separate folders for independent development.
